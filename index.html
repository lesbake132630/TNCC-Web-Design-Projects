			<p>Keep in mind that resumes/applications do not hire, hiring managers do. So, let your preparation and positive attitude be the key to your success in an interview. Interviewing is a critical part of the selection process and provides an opportunity for you to describe further your experience, education and training. It is also a chance for you to gain a better understanding of the organization and the position.</p>
			<p>The job interview is a two-way discussion between you and the interviewer. The interviewer is attempting to determine if you have the skills the position requires, and you are attempting to determine if you will accept the position if the job is offered. Both of you are trying to gain as much information as possible to make an informed decision.</p>

				<li>Research the organization</li>
				<li>Dress for success</li>
				<li>Answer honestly and well</li>
				<li>Arrive early</li>
				<li>Follow up</li>
			</ul>
